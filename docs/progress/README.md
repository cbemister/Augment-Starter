```

## Best Practices

### Documentation Standards
- **Timely Updates**: Record progress within 24 hours of milestones
- **Objective Assessment**: Use measurable criteria and avoid subjective judgments
- **Complete Context**: Include methodology, framework, and environmental factors
- **Forward-Looking**: Focus on actionable next steps and risk mitigation

### Methodology Alignment
- **Timeline Tracking**: Use methodology-appropriate milestone intervals
- **Quality Metrics**: Apply standards appropriate for chosen methodology
- **Scope Management**: Monitor scope changes against methodology boundaries
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate risks in context of methodology constraints

### Framework Considerations
- **Technology Metrics**: Track framework-specific performance and quality indicators
- **Build Metrics**: Monitor bundle size, build time, and development server performance
- **Integration Health**: Assess CSS Modules, design tokens, and component library status
- **Developer Experience**: Track productivity and tooling effectiveness

## Automation and Tooling

### Automated Progress Tracking
```bash
# Example automation scripts
npm run progress-report    # Generate weekly status report
npm run milestone-check    # Validate current milestone criteria
npm run blocker-summary    # Summarize active and resolved blockers
npm run context-backup     # Preserve current development context
```

### Integration with Development Tools
- **Git Hooks**: Automatic progress updates on commits and merges
