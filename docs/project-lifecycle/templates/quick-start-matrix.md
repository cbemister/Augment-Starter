### Troubleshooting Path
**For: Teams encountering issues or blockers**

#### Step 1: Identify Issue Type (30 seconds)
| Issue Type | Quick Action | Documentation |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Development Blocker** | Create active blocker | [Troubleshooting System](../../development/troubleshooting/README.md) |
| **Technology Decision** | Review decision criteria | [Technology Selection](../01-technology-stack-selection/README.md) |
| **Implementation Pattern** | Check core features | [Core Features](../../core-features/README.md) |
| **Methodology Question** | Review methodology guidance | [Methodology Selection](../decision-trees/methodology-selection.md) |

#### Step 2: Search Existing Solutions (30 seconds)
- [ ] **Resolved Issues**: [Search resolved issues](../../development/troubleshooting/resolved-issues/)
- [ ] **Core Features**: Check relevant feature troubleshooting guides
- [ ] **Framework Patterns**: [Review framework-specific patterns](../../knowledge/framework-patterns/)

#### Step 3: Document and Resolve (1 minute)
- [ ] Create active blocker if needed
- [ ] Follow [Troubleshooting Integration](../integration-matrices/troubleshooting-integration.md)
- [ ] Document resolution for future reference

### Project Assessment Path
**For: Teams evaluating existing projects or planning improvements**

#### Step 1: Current Phase Assessment (2 minutes)
Identify where your project currently stands:

| Phase | Key Indicators | Next Steps |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| **Conception** | Requirements unclear, scope undefined | Complete [Phase 0](../00-project-conception/README.md) |
| **Technology Selection** | Tech stack decisions pending | Complete [Phase 1](../01-technology-stack-selection/README.md) |
| **Setup** | Development environment incomplete | Complete [Phase 2](../02-project-setup/README.md) |
| **Design** | Architecture not fully defined | Complete [Phase 3](../03-design-and-architecture/README.md) |
| **Development** | Core features in progress | Continue [Phase 4](../04-core-development/README.md) |
| **Quality Assurance** | Testing and validation needed | Start [Phase 5](../05-quality-assurance/README.md) |
| **Deployment Prep** | Production readiness needed | Start [Phase 6](../06-deployment-preparation/README.md) |
| **Production** | Live application management | Continue [Phase 7](../07-production-deployment/README.md) |

#### Step 2: Methodology Validation (2 minutes)
Assess if current methodology still fits:
- [ ] **Timeline Changes**: Has timeline shifted significantly?
- [ ] **Scope Changes**: Have requirements changed substantially?
- [ ] **Team Changes**: Has team composition or skill level changed?
- [ ] **Quality Changes**: Have quality or compliance requirements changed?

#### Step 3: Gap Analysis (3 minutes)
Identify missing elements:
- [ ] **Documentation Gaps**: Missing phase documentation
- [ ] **Core Feature Gaps**: Unimplemented essential features
- [ ] **Quality Gaps**: Missing testing or security measures
- [ ] **Process Gaps**: Missing troubleshooting or knowledge capture
