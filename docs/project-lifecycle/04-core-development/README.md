## Troubleshooting Integration

### Active Development Issue Management
When encountering blockers during development:

1. **Create Active Blocker** (`docs/development/troubleshooting/active-blockers/`)
   ```
   YYYY-MM-DD_blocker_[component]_[issue-type]_[framework].md
   ```

2. **Reference Core Features** for implementation guidance
   - Check relevant best-practices.md files
   - Review common-patterns.md for solutions
   - Use troubleshooting.md for known issues

3. **Document Resolution** (`docs/development/troubleshooting/resolved-issues/`)
   - Move blocker to resolved with solution
   - Extract lessons learned
   - Update prevention strategies

### Common Development Patterns

#### Feature Implementation Workflow
```
1. Review Core Feature Documentation
2. Implement Following Best Practices
3. Write Tests (Unit ‚Üí Integration ‚Üí E2E)
4. Code Review and Refactoring
5. Documentation Updates
6. Integration with Other Features
```

#### Issue Resolution Workflow
```
1. Identify Issue ‚Üí Create Active Blocker
2. Research in Core Features Documentation
3. Attempt Resolution ‚Üí Document Attempts
4. Escalate if Needed ‚Üí Update Blocker
5. Resolve Issue ‚Üí Move to Resolved Issues
6. Extract Learning ‚Üí Update Knowledge Base
```
