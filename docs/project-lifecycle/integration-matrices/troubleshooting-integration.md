# Troubleshooting System Integration Strategy

**Purpose**: Define how the project lifecycle documentation integrates with the existing troubleshooting and knowledge management system for seamless issue resolution and continuous learning.

## Integration Architecture

### Bidirectional Knowledge Flow
```
Project Lifecycle Phases ←→ Troubleshooting System ←→ Knowledge Management
         ↓                           ↓                        ↓
   Phase-Specific Issues    →    Active Blockers    →    Lessons Learned
   Implementation Patterns  ←    Resolved Issues    ←    Prevention Strategies
   Best Practices Updates   ←    Methodology Decisions ←  Framework Patterns
```

- Performance benchmarking techniques

### Phase 4: Core Development
**Common Issues**:
- Authentication implementation problems
- Database performance issues
- API design challenges
- State management complexity
- Testing strategy difficulties

**Troubleshooting Integration**:
- **Active Blockers**: `YYYY-MM-DD_blocker_[feature]_[specific-issue]_[framework].md`
- **Resolved Issues**: Direct connection to core features troubleshooting guides
- **Framework Patterns**: Feature-specific implementation patterns

**Knowledge Capture**:
- Feature implementation patterns
- Integration solutions
- Performance optimization techniques
- Testing strategies and tools

## Cross-Reference System Design

### Automatic Cross-Referencing
Each project lifecycle phase includes automatic references to:

#### Core Features Documentation
```markdown
### Related Core Features
- [Authentication](../../core-features/authentication/README.md) - User management and security
- [Database](../../core-features/database/README.md) - Data persistence and optimization
- [API](../../core-features/api/README.md) - Service layer and integrations
```

#### Troubleshooting Resources
```markdown
### Troubleshooting Resources
- **Common Issues**: [Phase-Specific Troubleshooting](../../development/troubleshooting/framework-specific/[phase]-issues.md)
- **Active Blockers**: Create new blocker using naming convention
- **Resolved Solutions**: [Search resolved issues](../../development/troubleshooting/resolved-issues/)
```

#### Knowledge Management
```markdown
### Knowledge Resources
- **Lessons Learned**: [Phase Insights](../../knowledge/lessons-learned/[phase]-insights.md)
- **Prevention Strategies**: [Issue Prevention](../../knowledge/prevention-strategies/[phase]-prevention.md)
- **Framework Patterns**: [Reusable Patterns](../../knowledge/framework-patterns/[framework]-patterns.md)
```

### Manual Cross-Referencing Guidelines

#### When Creating Active Blockers
1. **Reference Current Phase**: Include phase context in blocker description
2. **Link to Phase Documentation**: Reference relevant phase guidance
3. **Connect to Core Features**: Link to applicable core feature documentation
4. **Tag Methodology**: Include methodology context for solution approach

#### When Resolving Issues
1. **Update Phase Documentation**: Enhance phase guidance with solution insights
2. **Contribute to Core Features**: Update core feature troubleshooting guides
3. **Create Prevention Strategies**: Document how to avoid similar issues
4. **Build Framework Patterns**: Extract reusable solution patterns
