## Methodology-Specific Integration

### MVP/Rapid Approach
**Core Features Priority**:
1. **Essential**: Basic authentication, simple database, minimal API
2. **Deferred**: Advanced state management, comprehensive error handling
3. **Minimal**: Basic testing, simple deployment

**Integration Strategy**:
- Implement core features with minimal configuration
- Use managed services where possible
- Focus on essential user workflows
- Defer optimization and advanced features

### Balanced/Standard Approach
**Core Features Priority**:
1. **Full Implementation**: All core features with standard patterns
2. **Balanced Complexity**: Moderate optimization and configuration
3. **Production Ready**: Comprehensive testing and error handling

**Integration Strategy**:
- Implement all core features following best practices
- Balance complexity with maintainability
- Include performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing coverage

### Comprehensive/Enterprise Approach
**Core Features Priority**:
