  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  enable_dns_support   = true

  tags = {
    Name        = "production-vpc"
    Environment = "production"
  }
}

resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  count             = 2
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.production.id
  cidr_block        = "10.0.${count.index + 1}.0/24"
  availability_zone = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[count.index]

  map_public_ip_on_launch = true

  tags = {
    Name = "production-public-${count.index + 1}"
  }
}

resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  count             = 2
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.production.id
  cidr_block        = "10.0.${count.index + 10}.0/24"
  availability_zone = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[count.index]

  tags = {
    Name = "production-private-${count.index + 1}"
  }
}
```

#### Container Orchestration (Kubernetes)

## Monitoring and Alerting Implementation

### Application Performance Monitoring

#### Prometheus and Grafana Setup
```yaml
# Prometheus Configuration
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

rule_files:
  - "alert_rules.yml"

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'myapp'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['myapp:3000']
    metrics_path: '/metrics'
    scrape_interval: 5s

  - job_name: 'node-exporter'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['node-exporter:9100']

alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets:
          - alertmanager:9093
```

#### Application Metrics Implementation
```javascript
// Application Metrics with Prometheus
const promClient = require('prom-client');

// Create metrics
const httpRequestDuration = new promClient.Histogram({
  name: 'http_request_duration_seconds',
  help: 'Duration of HTTP requests in seconds',
  labelNames: ['method', 'route', 'status_code'],
  buckets: [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10]
});

const httpRequestsTotal = new promClient.Counter({
  name: 'http_requests_total',
  help: 'Total number of HTTP requests',
  labelNames: ['method', 'route', 'status_code']
});

const activeConnections = new promClient.Gauge({
  name: 'active_connections',
  help: 'Number of active connections'
});

// Middleware to collect metrics
const metricsMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  const start = Date.now();

  res.on('finish', () => {
    const duration = (Date.now() - start) / 1000;
    const labels = {
      method: req.method,
      route: req.route?.path || req.path,
      status_code: res.statusCode
    };

    httpRequestDuration.observe(labels, duration);
    httpRequestsTotal.inc(labels);
  });

  next();
};

// Metrics endpoint
app.get('/metrics', (req, res) => {
  res.set('Content-Type', promClient.register.contentType);
  res.end(promClient.register.metrics());
});
```

#### Alert Rules Configuration
```yaml
# Alert Rules for Production
groups:
- name: myapp-alerts
  rules:
  - alert: HighErrorRate
    expr: rate(http_requests_total{status_code=~"5.."}[5m]) > 0.1
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "High error rate detected"
      description: "Error rate is {{ $value }} errors per second"

  - alert: HighResponseTime
    expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) > 1
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "High response time detected"
      description: "95th percentile response time is {{ $value }} seconds"

  - alert: DatabaseConnectionFailure
    expr: up{job="database"} == 0
    for: 1m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "Database connection failure"
      description: "Database is not responding"

  - alert: HighMemoryUsage
    expr: (node_memory_MemTotal_bytes - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes) / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes > 0.9
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "High memory usage"
      description: "Memory usage is {{ $value | humanizePercentage }}"
```
