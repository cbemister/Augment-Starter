# Feature Development Best Practices

**Purpose**: Comprehensive guidelines for individual feature development cycles within Phase 4 (Core Development)  
**Integration**: Seamlessly connects with existing Phase 4 documentation and core features system  
**Methodology Support**: MVP/Rapid, Balanced/Standard, Comprehensive/Enterprise

## Overview

This documentation provides detailed best practices for developing individual features within the Core Development phase. It bridges the gap between high-level phase planning and day-to-day development work, ensuring consistent quality and integration across all features.

## Feature Development Lifecycle

### 1. Feature Planning and Scoping

#### Scoping Guidelines by Methodology

**MVP/Rapid (2-4 weeks per feature)**
- Focus on essential functionality only
- Minimal customization and configuration
- Basic error handling and validation
- Essential unit tests only
- Simple integration patterns

**Balanced/Standard (4-8 weeks per feature)**
- Complete feature functionality
- Moderate customization options
- Comprehensive error handling
- Full testing coverage (unit + integration)
- Standard integration patterns

**Comprehensive/Enterprise (8-12 weeks per feature)**
- Full feature with enterprise enhancements
- Extensive customization and configuration
- Advanced error handling and monitoring

    J -->|No| E
```

#### Daily Development Workflow

**Morning Setup (15 minutes)**
1. Review feature progress and current task
2. Check for any blocking issues or dependencies
3. Review relevant core features documentation
4. Plan development tasks for the day

**Development Iteration (2-4 hours)**
1. Implement feature components following best practices
2. Write tests as you develop (TDD approach recommended)
3. Document any issues in active blockers
4. Commit frequently with meaningful messages

**End-of-Day Review (15 minutes)**
1. Review code changes and test coverage
2. Update feature progress tracking
3. Document any lessons learned
4. Plan next day's tasks

### 4. Quality Gates and Standards

#### Code Quality Standards

**Code Organization**
- Follow established project structure
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper separation of concerns
- Maintain clean and readable code

**Performance Standards**

- Implement efficient algorithms and data structures
- Consider memory usage and resource consumption
- Profile and benchmark critical paths

**Security Standards**
- Follow security best practices
- Implement input validation and sanitization
- Use secure authentication and authorization
- Protect against common vulnerabilities

#### Testing Standards

**Unit Testing Requirements**
- Minimum 80% code coverage (MVP), 90% (Balanced), 95% (Comprehensive)
- Test all public methods and functions
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Use meaningful test descriptions

**Integration Testing Requirements**
