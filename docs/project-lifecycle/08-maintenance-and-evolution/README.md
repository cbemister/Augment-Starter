#### Performance Optimization Workflow
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Weekly Performance Optimization Review

echo "=== Weekly Performance Review ==="

# Collect performance metrics
echo "Collecting performance metrics..."

# Response time analysis
RESPONSE_TIME=$(curl -o /dev/null -s -w '%{time_total}' https://myapp.com/api/health)
echo "Current API response time: ${RESPONSE_TIME}s"

# Database performance
DB_SLOW_QUERIES=$(psql -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_statements WHERE mean_time > 1000;" -t)
echo "Slow database queries (>1s): $DB_SLOW_QUERIES"

# Memory usage
MEMORY_USAGE=$(kubectl top nodes | awk 'NR>1 {sum+=$5} END {print sum/NR}')
echo "Average memory usage: $MEMORY_USAGE"

# Generate optimization recommendations
if (( $(echo "$RESPONSE_TIME > 0.5" | bc -l) )); then

### Database Performance Optimization

#### Query Performance Monitoring
```sql
-- Database Performance Analysis Queries

-- Top 10 slowest queries
SELECT
    query,
    calls,
    total_time,
    mean_time,
    rows,
    100.0 * shared_blks_hit / nullif(shared_blks_hit + shared_blks_read, 0) AS hit_percent
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY mean_time DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Index usage analysis
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    attname,
    n_distinct,
    correlation
FROM pg_stats
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY n_distinct DESC;

-- Table size analysis
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,

FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;
```

#### Automated Database Optimization

## Feature Evolution and Enhancement

### Feature Development Lifecycle

#### User Feedback Collection System
```javascript
// User Feedback Collection Implementation
const feedbackSystem = {
  // In-app feedback collection
  collectFeedback: async (userId, feedback) => {
    const feedbackData = {
      userId,
      feedback: feedback.message,
      rating: feedback.rating,
      feature: feedback.feature,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      userAgent: feedback.userAgent,
      page: feedback.page
    };

    await database.feedback.create(feedbackData);

    // Trigger analysis if critical feedback
    if (feedback.rating <= 2) {
      await triggerCriticalFeedbackAlert(feedbackData);
    }
  },

  // Analytics integration
  trackFeatureUsage: (feature, action, userId) => {
    analytics.track('Feature Usage', {
      feature,
      action,
      userId,
      timestamp: new Date()
    });
  },

  // A/B testing framework
  getFeatureVariant: (userId, featureName) => {
    const userSegment = getUserSegment(userId);
    return abTestingFramework.getVariant(featureName, userSegment);
  }
};
```

- **2**: Nice-to-have, low-medium usage
- **1**: Low user need, minimal usage

### Business Value (Weight: 30%)
- **5**: Direct revenue impact or critical business objective
- **4**: Significant business value or competitive advantage
- **3**: Moderate business value
- **2**: Minor business value
- **1**: Minimal business impact

### Development Effort (Weight: 20%)
- **5**: Minimal effort (< 1 week)
- **4**: Low effort (1-2 weeks)
- **3**: Medium effort (2-4 weeks)
- **2**: High effort (1-2 months)
- **1**: Very high effort (> 2 months)

### Technical Risk (Weight: 10%)
- **5**: No technical risk
- **4**: Low technical risk
- **3**: Medium technical risk
- **2**: High technical risk

## Technical Debt Management

### Technical Debt Assessment

#### Code Quality Monitoring
```javascript
// Technical Debt Tracking System
const technicalDebtMetrics = {
  codeQuality: {
    // SonarQube integration
    maintainabilityRating: 'Target: A',
    reliabilityRating: 'Target: A',
    securityRating: 'Target: A',
    coverage: 'Target: > 80%',
    duplicatedLines: 'Target: < 3%',
    technicalDebt: 'Target: < 1 day'
  },

  performance: {
    bundleSize: 'Monitor growth trend',
    loadTime: 'Target: < 2s',
    memoryLeaks: 'Monitor and fix',
    databaseQueries: 'Optimize slow queries'
  },

  architecture: {
    cyclomaticComplexity: 'Target: < 10 per function',
    coupling: 'Monitor module dependencies',
    cohesion: 'Ensure high cohesion',
    designPatterns: 'Follow established patterns'
  }
};
```

#### Refactoring Prioritization
```markdown
# Technical Debt Refactoring Priority Matrix

## High Priority (Address Immediately)
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance bottlenecks affecting users
- Critical bugs causing system instability
- Code preventing new feature development

## Medium Priority (Address in Next Sprint)
- Code duplication > 10%
- Functions with complexity > 15
- Modules with high coupling
- Outdated dependencies with known issues

## Low Priority (Address in Maintenance Cycles)
- Minor code style inconsistencies
- Non-critical documentation updates
- Optimization opportunities
- Nice-to-have refactoring improvements

## Refactoring Guidelines
1. **Measure Impact**: Quantify the benefit of refactoring
2. **Test Coverage**: Ensure adequate tests before refactoring
3. **Incremental Changes**: Make small, manageable changes
4. **Validate Results**: Measure improvement after refactoring
```

### Long-term System Evolution

#### Technology Stack Evolution Planning
```markdown
