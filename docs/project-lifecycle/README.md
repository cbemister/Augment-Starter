# Project Lifecycle Documentation Framework

**Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation system that guides development from initial idea through production deployment, seamlessly integrating with existing core features and troubleshooting systems.

## Overview

This framework bridges the gap between project conception and detailed implementation by providing structured guidance through all development phases. It integrates with your existing three-methodology approach (MVP/Rapid, Balanced/Standard, Comprehensive/Enterprise) and connects to core feature documentation and troubleshooting systems.

## Framework Architecture

### 🎯 **Phase-Based Structure**
The lifecycle is organized into sequential phases, each with methodology-specific guidance and clear integration points to existing documentation.

### 🔄 **Integration Points**
- **Core Features**: Direct connections to authentication, database, API, state management, error handling, and testing documentation
- **Troubleshooting System**: Seamless workflow from active blockers to resolved issues and prevention strategies
- **Knowledge Management**: Continuous learning capture and pattern development

### 📊 **Decision Support**
- Technology stack selection matrices
- Methodology selection criteria
- Risk assessment frameworks
- Scope adjustment decision trees
