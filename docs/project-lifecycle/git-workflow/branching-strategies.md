# Git Branching Strategies

**Purpose**: Detailed branching strategies for different development methodologies and scenarios  
**Integration**: Supports the main Git workflow documentation with specific implementation guidance

## Methodology-Specific Branching Strategies

### MVP/Rapid Development (2-4 weeks)

#### Branch Structure
```
main
├── develop
├── feature/core-auth (1-2 days)
├── feature/basic-api (1-2 days)
├── feature/simple-ui (2-3 days)
└── release/v1.0.0-mvp
```

#### Strategy Characteristics
- **Minimal branches**: Focus on essential features only
- **Short-lived branches**: Features completed in 1-3 days
- **Fast integration**: Daily merges to develop
- **Simple workflow**: Reduced complexity for speed

#### Branch Policies
- **Feature branches**: 
  - Maximum 3 days lifespan
  - Single developer ownership
  - Basic testing required
  - Quick review process (4-8 hours)

- **Develop branch**:
  - Daily integration
  - Automated testing only
  - Fast-track to release

- **Release branches**:
  - Minimal stabilization period (1-2 days)
  - Essential bug fixes only
  - Quick deployment cycle

### Balanced/Standard Development (4-8 weeks)

#### Branch Structure
```
main

## Specialized Branching Scenarios

### Sandbox Methodology Development

#### Purpose
Parallel development of alternative approaches for comparison and selection.

#### Branch Structure
```
develop
├── sandbox/design-system-methodology-a
│   ├── docs/methodology-a-approach.md
│   ├── src/components-a/
│   └── examples/demo-a/
├── sandbox/design-system-methodology-b
│   ├── docs/methodology-b-approach.md
│   ├── src/components-b/
│   └── examples/demo-b/
└── sandbox/design-system-methodology-c
    ├── docs/methodology-c-approach.md
    ├── src/components-c/
    └── examples/demo-c/
```

#### Workflow Process
1. **Create sandbox branches** from develop
2. **Develop methodologies independently**
3. **Deploy each to static hosting** for comparison
4. **Evaluate and select methodology**
5. **Cherry-pick selected features** to feature branch
6. **Integrate selected approach** into develop

#### Integration Strategy
- **No direct merges**: Sandbox branches never merge directly
- **Cherry-pick selection**: Pick specific commits/features
- **Documentation-driven**: Each methodology fully documented
- **Static deployment**: Each methodology deployed for evaluation

### Hotfix Development

#### Emergency Hotfix Process
```
main (production issue detected)
├── hotfix/critical-security-patch
│   ├── fix implementation
│   ├── emergency testing
│   └── immediate deployment
└── develop (back-merge hotfix)
```

#### Workflow Steps
1. **Create hotfix branch** from main
2. **Implement minimal fix** addressing the issue
3. **Emergency testing** (automated + manual)
4. **Fast-track review** (1-2 reviewers, 2-4 hours)
5. **Deploy to production** immediately
6. **Back-merge to develop** to prevent regression

#### Hotfix Policies
- **Time-boxed development**: Maximum 4-8 hours
- **Minimal scope**: Address only the critical issue
- **Emergency review**: Reduced review requirements
- **Immediate testing**: Automated tests + critical path manual testing
- **Documentation required**: Document the fix and root cause

### Release Branch Management

#### Release Preparation Process
```
develop (feature complete)
├── release/v1.2.0
│   ├── version bumping
│   ├── changelog generation
│   ├── final testing
│   ├── bug fixes only
│   └── documentation updates
└── main (after release validation)
```

#### Release Branch Workflow
1. **Create release branch** when feature complete
2. **Version management** (bump version numbers)
3. **Changelog generation** (automated + manual review)
4. **Final testing cycle** (full regression testing)
5. **Bug fixes only** (no new features)
6. **Documentation finalization**
7. **Merge to main** after validation
8. **Tag release** with version number
9. **Back-merge to develop** for ongoing development

#### Release Policies by Methodology

**MVP/Rapid**:
- 1-2 day release cycle
- Essential testing only
- Minimal documentation updates
- Fast deployment

**Balanced/Standard**:
- 3-5 day release cycle
- Comprehensive testing
- Complete documentation
- Standard deployment process

**Comprehensive/Enterprise**:
- 7-10 day release cycle
- Extensive testing and validation
- Complete documentation and compliance
- Careful deployment with rollback plans

## Branch Protection Rules

### Main Branch Protection
```yaml
protection_rules:
  required_reviews: 2  # Comprehensive/Enterprise
  required_reviews: 1  # Balanced/Standard  
  required_reviews: 1  # MVP/Rapid
  dismiss_stale_reviews: true
  require_code_owner_reviews: true
  required_status_checks:
    - continuous-integration
    - security-scan
    - performance-test  # Balanced/Comprehensive only
  enforce_admins: true
  allow_force_pushes: false
  allow_deletions: false
```

### Develop Branch Protection
```yaml
protection_rules:
  required_reviews: 1
  dismiss_stale_reviews: false
  required_status_checks:
    - continuous-integration
    - unit-tests
    - integration-tests
  enforce_admins: false
  allow_force_pushes: false
  allow_deletions: false
```

### Feature Branch Guidelines
- **Naming convention**: `feature/[issue-number]-[short-description]`
- **Base branch**: Always from develop
- **Lifespan**: Methodology-dependent (see above)
- **Testing**: Required before merge
- **Review**: Required before merge

## Branch Cleanup and Maintenance

### Automated Cleanup
- **Merged feature branches**: Delete after 30 days
- **Stale branches**: Alert after methodology-specific timeframes
- **Sandbox branches**: Keep for methodology comparison, archive after selection

### Manual Cleanup
- **Release branches**: Keep for historical reference
- **Hotfix branches**: Keep for audit trail
- **Failed experiments**: Document lessons learned before deletion

## Integration with Development Tools

### IDE Integration
- **Branch switching**: Quick access to active branches
- **Merge conflict resolution**: Visual tools for conflict resolution
- **Commit templates**: Pre-filled commit message templates

### CI/CD Integration
- **Branch-based builds**: Different build processes per branch type
- **Automated testing**: Branch-specific test suites
- **Deployment automation**: Branch-based deployment rules

## Troubleshooting Common Branching Issues

### Merge Conflicts
- **Prevention**: Regular rebasing with base branch
- **Resolution**: Use established conflict resolution guide
- **Documentation**: Record resolution decisions

### Long-Running Branches
- **Prevention**: Methodology-specific time limits
- **Resolution**: Break into smaller features
- **Integration**: Regular integration with develop

### Branch Divergence
- **Prevention**: Regular synchronization
- **Resolution**: Careful rebasing or merge strategies
- **Communication**: Team coordination on branch status
