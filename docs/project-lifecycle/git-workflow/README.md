# Git Workflow and Policies

**Purpose**: Comprehensive Git policies and best practices for the development process  
**Integration**: Enhances existing Git documentation and integrates with CI/CD from Phase 2  
**Methodology Support**: MVP/Rapid, Balanced/Standard, Comprehensive/Enterprise

## Overview

This documentation provides comprehensive Git workflow policies and best practices that integrate seamlessly with the project lifecycle framework. It builds upon and enhances the existing Git documentation while providing methodology-specific guidance for different development approaches.

## Git Workflow Strategy

### Branch Structure and Hierarchy

```
main (production)
├── develop (integration)
├── release/v1.2.0 (release preparation)
├── feature/user-authentication (feature development)
├── feature/api-integration (feature development)
├── hotfix/security-patch (emergency fixes)
├── sandbox/design-system-methodology-a (methodology exploration)
├── sandbox/design-system-methodology-b (methodology exploration)
└── sandbox/design-system-methodology-c (methodology exploration)
```

### Branch Types and Purposes

#### 1. **Main Branch** (`main`)
- **Purpose**: Production-ready code only
- **Protection**: Protected branch with required reviews
- **Merges**: Only from `release/*` branches after full testing
- **Deployment**: Automatic deployment to production environment
- **Policies**:
  - Requires 2+ approving reviews (Balanced/Comprehensive)
  - Requires 1+ approving review (MVP)
  - All status checks must pass
  - No direct pushes allowed
  - Merge commits required

#### 2. **Develop Branch** (`develop`)
- **Purpose**: Integration branch for completed features
- **Merges**: From `feature/*` branches after methodology selection
- **Testing**: Continuous integration and automated testing
- **Deployment**: Automatic deployment to staging environment
- **Policies**:
  - Requires 1+ approving review
  - All tests must pass
  - Squash and merge preferred
  - Regular integration with main

#### 3. **Feature Branches** (`feature/[feature-name]`)
- **Purpose**: Individual feature development
- **Naming Convention**: `feature/user-authentication`, `feature/api-integration`
- **Base**: Created from `develop` branch
- **Merges**: Back to `develop` after completion and testing
- **Policies**:
  - Regular rebasing with develop
  - Feature-specific testing required
  - Code review before merge

#### 4. **Release Branches** (`release/[version]`)
- **Purpose**: Release preparation and stabilization
- **Naming Convention**: `release/v1.2.0`, `release/v2.0.0-beta`
- **Base**: Created from `develop` branch
- **Merges**: To `main` and back-merge to `develop`
- **Policies**:
  - No new features, only bug fixes
  - Comprehensive testing required
  - Documentation updates included

#### 5. **Hotfix Branches** (`hotfix/[issue-name]`)
- **Purpose**: Emergency fixes for production issues
- **Naming Convention**: `hotfix/security-patch`, `hotfix/critical-bug`
- **Base**: Created from `main` branch
- **Merges**: To `main` and `develop`
- **Policies**:
  - Fast-track review process
  - Immediate testing required
  - Documentation of fix required

#### 6. **Sandbox Branches** (`sandbox/[methodology-name]`)
- **Purpose**: Methodology exploration and comparison
- **Naming Convention**: `sandbox/design-system-methodology-a`
- **Base**: Created from `develop` or specific feature branch
- **Merges**: Cherry-pick specific features, not full merges
- **Policies**:
  - Independent development
  - Static deployment for comparison
  - Documentation-driven approach

## Commit Message Conventions

## Merge Strategies

### Strategy Selection by Branch Type

#### Feature to Develop
- **Strategy**: Squash and Merge
- **Rationale**: Clean history, single commit per feature
- **Requirements**: All commits squashed into meaningful message

#### Release to Main
- **Strategy**: Merge Commit
- **Rationale**: Preserve release history and branch structure
- **Requirements**: All tests pass, documentation complete

#### Hotfix to Main/Develop
- **Strategy**: Merge Commit
- **Rationale**: Preserve emergency fix history
- **Requirements**: Fast-track review, immediate testing

#### Sandbox Cherry-picking
- **Strategy**: Cherry-pick specific commits
- **Rationale**: Select specific features without full methodology
- **Requirements**: Conflict resolution, integration testing

### Merge Conflict Resolution

#### Conflict Resolution Process

1. **Identify Conflict Type**
   - Documentation conflicts
   - Implementation conflicts
   - Configuration conflicts

2. **Choose Resolution Strategy**
   - Use existing [Git Conflict Resolution Guide](../../development/GIT_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_GUIDE.md)
   - Apply methodology-specific strategies
   - Document resolution decisions

3. **Resolve and Validate**
   - Resolve conflicts manually or with tools
   - Run full test suite
   - Verify functionality
   - Update documentation

#### Methodology-Specific Conflict Resolution

**MVP/Rapid Approach**:
- Favor simpler solutions
- Quick resolution over perfect solution
- Document decisions for future reference

**Balanced/Standard Approach**:
- Thorough analysis of conflicts
- Consider long-term implications
- Comprehensive testing after resolution

**Comprehensive/Enterprise Approach**:
- Detailed conflict analysis
- Multiple stakeholder review
- Extensive testing and validation
- Complete documentation of resolution

## Integration with CI/CD

### Continuous Integration Triggers

#### Branch-Based Triggers
- **Feature branches**: Run tests, linting, security scans
- **Develop branch**: Full test suite, integration tests, deployment to staging
- **Release branches**: Complete test suite, performance tests, security audit
- **Main branch**: Full validation, deployment to production

#### Pull Request Triggers
- **On creation**: Basic validation, automated tests
- **On update**: Re-run all checks, update status
- **On approval**: Final validation before merge

### Quality Gates

#### Automated Quality Checks
- [ ] Code linting and formatting
- [ ] Unit test coverage thresholds
- [ ] Integration test execution
- [ ] Security vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Performance regression testing
- [ ] Documentation validation

#### Manual Quality Gates
- [ ] Code review approval
- [ ] Security review (for sensitive changes)
- [ ] Performance review (for performance-critical changes)
- [ ] Documentation review
- [ ] Stakeholder approval (for major features)
