# Methodology Decisions Directory

**Purpose**: Document framework and approach decisions made during troubleshooting that impact methodology choice or implementation strategy

## When to Create Methodology Decision Files

### Decision Triggers
- [ ] Troubleshooting reveals need to change methodology (MVP ↔ Balanced ↔ Enterprise)
- [ ] Technical constraints require scope or timeline adjustments
- [ ] Framework limitations impact methodology feasibility
- [ ] Architecture decisions affect long-term project approach
- [ ] Quality vs timeline trade-offs require methodology adaptation

### Decision Types
- **Methodology Pivot**: Switching between MVP/Balanced/Enterprise approaches
- **Scope Adjustment**: Modifying features or requirements within methodology
- **Timeline Modification**: Adjusting schedule while maintaining methodology
- **Quality Trade-off**: Accepting technical debt or reducing standards
- **Framework Choice**: Selecting or changing technology stack
- **Architecture Decision**: Structural choices affecting methodology execution

## File Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD_decision_[decision-type]_[methodology]_[rationale].md`

### Decision Types
- `methodology-pivot`: Changing from one methodology to another
- `scope-reduction`: Reducing features or requirements
- `timeline-extension`: Adding time to current methodology
- `quality-tradeoff`: Accepting lower standards for timeline
- `framework-change`: Switching technology stack
- `architecture-choice`: Structural or design decisions

### Methodology Tags
- `mvp-to-balanced`: Upgrading from MVP to Balanced approach
- `balanced-to-mvp`: Downgrading from Balanced to MVP approach
- `enterprise-to-balanced`: Reducing from Enterprise to Balanced
- `methodology-a`, `methodology-b`, `methodology-c`: Reference Documentation choices

### Rationale Tags
- `timeline-pressure`: Decision driven by schedule constraints
- `quality-requirements`: Decision driven by quality standards
- `technical-constraints`: Decision driven by framework/technology limitations
- `team-capacity`: Decision driven by available resources or expertise
- `scope-creep`: Decision driven by expanding requirements

## File Structure Template

Each methodology decision file should include:

1. **Decision Summary** (what was decided and why)
2. **Context and Triggers** (what led to this decision)
3. **Options Considered** (alternatives evaluated)
4. **Impact Analysis** (timeline, scope, quality, resource implications)
5. **Implementation Plan** (how decision will be executed)
6. **Success Criteria** (how to measure decision effectiveness)
7. **Rollback Plan** (how to reverse if decision proves wrong)
8. **Lessons for Future** (insights for similar situations)

## Best Practices

### Decision Documentation
- **Timely Recording**: Document decisions within 24 hours of making them
- **Complete Context**: Include all factors that influenced the decision
- **Objective Analysis**: Present facts and trade-offs without bias
- **Clear Rationale**: Explain reasoning in terms others can understand

### Methodology Alignment
- **Framework Integration**: Ensure decisions align with three-methodology framework
- **Reference Documentation**: Connect to appropriate methodology documents
- **Validation Criteria**: Use established success metrics for chosen methodology
- **Timeline Constraints**: Respect methodology-specific time boundaries

### Stakeholder Communication
- **Clear Impact**: Explain implications for timeline, scope, and quality
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential negative consequences
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Provide plans to address identified risks
- **Success Metrics**: Define measurable outcomes for decision validation

## Methodology-Specific Considerations

### MVP/Rapid Decisions (2-4 weeks)
- **Focus**: Speed and core functionality over perfection
- **Trade-offs**: Accept technical debt for timeline adherence
- **Scope**: Aggressive feature reduction to meet deadlines
- **Quality**: Functional requirements over polish and optimization

### Balanced/Standard Decisions (4-8 weeks)
- **Focus**: Balance between quality and timeline
- **Trade-offs**: Moderate compromises on both sides
- **Scope**: Essential features with selective enhancements
- **Quality**: Production-ready with acceptable technical debt

### Comprehensive/Enterprise Decisions (8-12 weeks)
- **Focus**: Long-term sustainability and architectural soundness
- **Trade-offs**: Timeline flexibility for quality and maintainability
- **Scope**: Full feature set with advanced capabilities
- **Quality**: Enterprise standards with minimal technical debt

## Framework Impact Assessment

### React/Next.js Decisions
- Component architecture and state management choices
- Build configuration and deployment strategy decisions
- TypeScript integration and type safety requirements
- Performance optimization and bundle size considerations

### Vue/Nuxt.js Decisions
- Single File Component vs Composition API approaches
- Nuxt.js module selection and configuration choices
- State management and reactivity pattern decisions
- Build tool and development workflow selections

### Angular Decisions
- Component encapsulation and module structure choices
- Dependency injection and service architecture decisions
- Build optimization and deployment strategy selections
- TypeScript configuration and tooling decisions

### Vanilla JavaScript Decisions
- Module system and bundling approach choices
- Browser compatibility and polyfill decisions
- Build tool selection and configuration choices
- Framework-agnostic pattern implementations

## Integration with Reference Documentation

### Methodology Alignment
```markdown
## Reference Documentation Alignment

### Current Methodology
**Chosen Approach**: [Methodology A/B/C from Reference Documentation]
**Documentation**: `docs/sandbox/[phase]/[methodology-file].md`
**Rationale**: [Why this methodology was selected]

### Decision Impact
**Methodology Change**: [If switching methodologies]
**Scope Adjustment**: [If modifying within methodology]
**Timeline Impact**: [Effect on methodology schedule]
**Quality Standards**: [Effect on methodology quality criteria]
```

### Validation Criteria Updates
- Update milestone validation criteria based on decisions
- Modify progress tracking templates for new approach
- Adjust success metrics for changed methodology
- Document new escalation criteria if applicable

## Cross-Directory Integration

### Decision Flow
```
Troubleshooting → Methodology Decision → Implementation → Validation
       ↓                    ↓                  ↓            ↓
Active Blockers → Decision Logs → Progress Tracking → Lessons Learned
```
