# Resolved Issues Directory

**Purpose**: Archive of successfully resolved development problems with complete solutions

## When to Create Resolved Issue Files

### Resolution Triggers
- [ ] Active blocker successfully resolved with working solution
- [ ] Technical problem solved after investigation period
- [ ] Workaround implemented that restores development progress
- [ ] Issue resolved through session restart with lessons learned
- [ ] Framework or configuration problem fixed with documented steps

### Knowledge Preservation Goals
- **Solution Documentation**: Complete steps to resolve similar issues
- **Learning Extraction**: Insights applicable to future development
- **Pattern Recognition**: Common issue types and effective solutions
- **Prevention Strategy**: How to avoid this problem in future projects

## File Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD_resolved_[component-name]_[issue-type]_[framework].md`

### Resolution Types
- `resolved-fix`: Direct technical solution implemented
- `resolved-workaround`: Temporary solution allowing progress
- `resolved-restart`: Issue resolved by restarting with different approach
- `resolved-scope`: Issue resolved by reducing or changing scope
- `resolved-escalation`: Issue resolved through external help or resources

## File Structure Template

Each resolved issue file should include:

1. **Problem Summary** (original issue description)
2. **Resolution Summary** (what ultimately worked)
3. **Investigation Timeline** (time invested and approaches tried)
4. **Complete Solution** (step-by-step implementation)
5. **Framework-Specific Details** (technology considerations)
6. **Lessons Learned** (insights for future application)
7. **Prevention Strategies** (how to avoid this issue)
8. **Related Issues** (connections to other problems/solutions)

## Best Practices

### Documentation Standards
- **Complete Solutions**: Include all steps needed to reproduce fix
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain original problem context and constraints
- **Framework Details**: Specify versions, configurations, and dependencies
- **Time Investment**: Record actual time spent for future planning

### Solution Quality
- **Reproducible**: Others can follow steps to achieve same result
- **Sustainable**: Solution doesn't create technical debt or future problems
- **Methodology-Appropriate**: Aligns with project timeline and quality standards
- **Framework-Compliant**: Follows technology best practices and conventions

### Knowledge Extraction
- **Transferable Insights**: Identify patterns applicable to other projects
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Understand why problem occurred
- **Prevention Focus**: Emphasize proactive measures over reactive fixes
- **Team Learning**: Capture knowledge for team capability building

## Methodology Integration

### MVP/Rapid Resolutions
- **Focus**: Quick fixes and workarounds that restore progress
- **Quality**: Acceptable technical debt with documentation for future cleanup
- **Timeline**: Solutions implemented within 30-minute investigation limit
- **Scope**: May involve feature reduction or simplification

### Balanced/Standard Resolutions
- **Focus**: Sustainable solutions balancing quality and timeline
- **Quality**: Moderate refactoring acceptable if timeline permits
- **Timeline**: Solutions within 60-minute investigation limit
- **Scope**: Feature modifications acceptable if user experience preserved

### Comprehensive/Enterprise Resolutions
- **Focus**: Architectural soundness and long-term maintainability
- **Quality**: Thorough solutions meeting enterprise standards
- **Timeline**: Extended investigation permitted (90+ minutes)
- **Scope**: Full feature implementation with proper architecture

## Framework-Specific Considerations

### React/Next.js Resolutions
- Component lifecycle and state management solutions
- Build configuration and webpack customizations
- SSR/SSG specific fixes and optimizations
- TypeScript integration and type safety improvements

### Vue/Nuxt.js Resolutions
- Single File Component and scoped style solutions
- Nuxt.js configuration and module integrations
- Reactivity and composition API implementations
- Build tool and development server configurations

### Angular Resolutions
- Component encapsulation and dependency injection solutions
- Angular CLI configuration and build optimizations
- Module system and lazy loading implementations
- TypeScript and decorator-specific solutions

### Vanilla JavaScript Resolutions
- Module system and bundling solutions
- Browser compatibility and polyfill implementations
- Build tool configuration and optimization
- Framework-agnostic patterns and best practices

## Cross-Directory Integration

### Knowledge Flow
```
Active Blockers → Resolved Issues → Lessons Learned → Prevention Strategies
                      ↓                    ↓                    ↓
                 Decision Logs → Framework Patterns → Best Practices
```

### Related Processes
- **From Active Blockers**: Issues moved here upon resolution
- **To Lessons Learned**: Extract transferable knowledge and patterns
- **To Prevention Strategies**: Develop proactive measures
- **To Framework Patterns**: Build technology-specific guidance
