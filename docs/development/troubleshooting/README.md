# Development Troubleshooting Directory

**Purpose**: Central repository for active and resolved development issues in App Development projects

## Directory Structure

### `/active-blockers/`
**Purpose**: Current unresolved issues that are blocking development progress
**When to Use**: When encountering problems that halt development for >15 minutes
**Integration**: Links to Session Recovery Process and Troubleshooting Protocol

### `/resolved-issues/`
**Purpose**: Completed problem resolutions with detailed solutions
**When to Use**: After successfully resolving blockers, for knowledge preservation
**Integration**: Feeds into lessons-learned and prevention strategies

### `/methodology-decisions/`
**Purpose**: Framework and approach decisions made during troubleshooting
**When to Use**: When troubleshooting leads to architectural or methodology choices
**Integration**: Aligns with three-methodology framework (MVP/Balanced/Enterprise)

### `/framework-specific/`
**Purpose**: Technology-specific solutions and patterns
**When to Use**: For React, Vue, Angular, or vanilla JS specific issues
**Integration**: Framework-agnostic protocols with technology-specific implementations

## File Naming Conventions

All files follow the pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_[type]_[component]_[issue-type]_[framework].md`

**Examples**:
- `2025-07-10_blocker_button-component_css-modules_react.md`
- `2025-07-10_resolved_design-tokens_inheritance_vue.md`
- `2025-07-10_decision_architecture_methodology-b_angular.md`
- `2025-07-10_pattern_responsive-design_vanilla-js.md`

## Best Practices

### Documentation Standards
1. **Be Specific**: Include exact error messages, file paths, and framework versions
2. **Include Context**: Methodology phase, timeline constraints, team capacity
3. **Document Attempts**: Record all attempted solutions with time invested
4. **Capture Learning**: Extract transferable knowledge for future projects

### Methodology Integration
- **MVP/Rapid**: Focus on quick fixes and scope reduction strategies
- **Balanced/Standard**: Balance quality and timeline considerations
- **Comprehensive/Enterprise**: Emphasize architectural soundness and long-term solutions

### Framework Considerations
- **React/Next.js**: Component lifecycle, hooks, SSR/SSG issues
- **Vue/Nuxt.js**: Single File Components, reactivity, Nuxt configuration
- **Angular**: Component encapsulation, CLI configuration, dependency injection
- **Vanilla JS**: Module systems, build tools, browser compatibility

## Quick Reference

### Emergency Triage (0-5 minutes)
1. Create active blocker file with immediate assessment
2. Follow Session Recovery Process for derailment
3. Use Troubleshooting Protocol for specific technical issues

### Resolution Documentation (5-10 minutes)
1. Move active blocker to resolved issues with solution
2. Extract lessons learned for knowledge base
3. Update prevention strategies if applicable

### Knowledge Building (10-15 minutes)
1. Identify patterns across resolved issues
2. Create framework-specific guidance
3. Update methodology decision documentation
