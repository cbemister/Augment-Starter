# Development Session Recovery Process

**Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: July 2025  
**Purpose**: Framework-agnostic recovery process for derailed App Development development sessions  
**Integration**: Works with Troubleshooting Protocol and three-methodology framework

## ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE TRIAGE PROTOCOL (0-5 Minutes)

### Quick Assessment Checklist

**Step 1: Identify Derailment Type** (30 seconds)
- [ ] **Technical Blocker**: Code/build/framework issue preventing progress
- [ ] **Context Loss**: Interruption/task switch causing mental model loss
- [ ] **Scope Creep**: Requirements/features expanding beyond methodology limits
- [ ] **Environment Failure**: Build tools/dependencies/configuration broken
- [ ] **Design System Conflict**: Architecture/token/component conflicts
- [ ] **Capacity Change**: Team member unavailable/knowledge gap identified

**Step 2: Emergency Stabilization** (2 minutes)
```bash
# Universal Stabilization Commands (Framework-Agnostic)
git status                    # Check uncommitted changes
git stash push -m "emergency-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)"
git log --oneline -5         # Recent commit history
npm list --depth=0          # Dependency state (or yarn list)
```

**Step 3: Methodology Impact Assessment** (2 minutes)
| Methodology | Timeline Impact Threshold | Quality Impact Threshold | Scope Impact Threshold |
|-------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **MVP/Rapid** | >4 hours (>12.5% of week) | Core features affected | >20% feature reduction |
| **Balanced/Standard** | >1 day (>12.5% of phase) | User experience degraded | >15% scope change |
| **Comprehensive/Enterprise** | >2 days (>8% of phase) | Architecture compromised | >10% scope expansion |

**Step 4: Framework State Preservation** (30 seconds)
```markdown

**Immediate Triage** (2 minutes):
```bash
# Quick assessment
git status
npm --version
node --version
ls -la package*.json
```

**Recovery Steps** (15 minutes max for MVP):
1. **Environment Reset** (5 min):
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json .next
   npm cache clean --force
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configuration Validation** (5 min):
   ```bash
   npm run build --verbose
   npx next info
   ```

3. **Fallback Strategy** (5 min):
   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Last known working state
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

**Decision Point**: If not resolved in 15 minutes â†’ Restart with scope reduction

### Scenario 2: Context Loss After Interruption (Vue/Balanced)
**Situation**: 3-hour interruption, lost mental model, Week 4 of 6-week project

**Context Reconstruction** (20 minutes max for Balanced):
1. **Git History Analysis** (5 min):
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -10 --stat
   git show HEAD --name-only
   git diff HEAD~2..HEAD
   ```

2. **Documentation Review** (10 min):
   - Check `docs/progress/context-preservation/` for recent files
   - Review methodology documentation for current phase
   - Scan component files for TODO comments and recent changes

3. **AI Assistant Restoration** (5 min):
   ```markdown
   I'm recovering context after a 3-hour interruption. Here's what I can piece together:

   **Last Commit**: [commit message and hash]
   **Modified Files**: [list from git status]
   **Current Phase**: Week 4 of Balanced methodology - [phase name]

   Can you help me understand what I was working on and what the next logical steps would be?
   ```

### Scenario 3: Scope Creep Derailment (Angular/Enterprise)
**Situation**: Feature requirements expanded 40%, Week 8 of 12-week project

**Scope Management** (30 minutes max for Enterprise):
1. **Impact Assessment** (10 min):
   ```markdown
   ## Scope Expansion Analysis
   **Original Scope**: [List original features]
   **New Requirements**: [List added features]
   **Expansion Percentage**: 40%
   **Timeline Impact**: [Calculate additional weeks needed]
   ```

2. **Stakeholder Communication** (10 min):

   **Current Status**: Week 8 of 12 (67% complete)
   **New Requirements**: [List with effort estimates]
   **Options**:
   1. Extend timeline by [X] weeks
   2. Defer [specific features] to Phase 2
   3. Reduce quality standards for [specific areas]

   **Recommendation**: [Based on Enterprise methodology constraints]
   ```

3. **Recovery Strategy** (10 min):
   - Document scope changes in methodology documentation
   - Update milestone validation criteria
   - Adjust progress tracking templates
   - Implement scope freeze for remaining timeline

### Scenario 4: Framework Version Conflict (Vanilla JS/MVP)
**Situation**: Dependency update broke CSS Modules, Day 8 of 14-day MVP

**Emergency Resolution** (20 minutes max for MVP):
1. **Immediate Rollback** (5 min):
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5
   git reset --hard [last-working-commit]
   npm install
   ```

2. **Dependency Lock** (5 min):
   ```bash
   npm shrinkwrap  # Lock current working versions
   echo "# Dependency freeze for MVP completion" >> package.json
   ```

3. **Documentation** (10 min):
   ```markdown
   ## MVP Dependency Freeze
   **Reason**: Version conflict breaking CSS Modules
   **Frozen At**: [commit hash]
   **Post-MVP Action**: Investigate and resolve dependency conflicts
