## Development Methodology

### Solo Development with AI Assistants

#### Reference Documentation Requirements
**MANDATORY**: Every phase and sub-phase MUST include a Reference Documentation section with three alternative methodologies following this exact structure:

```markdown
#### Reference Documentation
[Phase/Feature name] with three alternative [implementation/approach] methodologies:
- **Foundation**: `docs/sandbox/[phase-number]-[phase-folder]/00-[phase-name]-foundation.md`
- **Methodology A**: `docs/sandbox/[phase-number]-[phase-folder]/01-[methodology-a-name].md` ([Brief description of approach A])
- **Methodology B**: `docs/sandbox/[phase-number]-[phase-folder]/02-[methodology-b-name].md` ([Brief description of approach B])
- **Methodology C**: `docs/sandbox/[phase-number]-[phase-folder]/03-[methodology-c-name].md` ([Brief description of approach C])

**Selection Criteria**: [Guidance for choosing between methodologies based on project constraints, team expertise, timeline, and business requirements]
```

#### Three-Methodology Approach Guidelines
Each Reference Documentation section must provide three distinct approaches that offer different trade-offs:

1. **Methodology A**: [Conservative/Simple/Proven approach]
   - Lower complexity, faster implementation
   - Proven patterns, minimal risk
   - May sacrifice some performance or features for simplicity

2. **Methodology B**: [Balanced/Modern/Optimized approach]
   - Moderate complexity, balanced implementation
   - Modern patterns with good performance
   - Balances features, performance, and maintainability

3. **Methodology C**: [Advanced/Complex/High-performance approach]
   - Higher complexity, comprehensive implementation
   - Cutting-edge patterns, maximum performance
   - May require more expertise and maintenance overhead

#### Reference Documentation Validation Checklist
