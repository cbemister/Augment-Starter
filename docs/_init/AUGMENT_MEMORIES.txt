Avoid abbreviations, use descriptive names, maintain consistency within file type categories, and follow [FRAMEWORK_SPECIFIC] naming conventions where applicable.

# Troubleshooting and Knowledge Management System

## Troubleshooting Workflow Rules
- **Active Blockers Directory** (`docs/development/troubleshooting/active-blockers/`): Create new blocker files immediately when encountering issues that halt development for >15 minutes. Use format `YYYY-MM-DD_blocker_[component]_[framework].md` with mandatory sections: Problem Description, Impact Assessment (Critical/High/Medium/Low), Attempted Solutions, Current Status, Next Steps, and Time Investment. Update status every 30 minutes during active troubleshooting.
- **Resolved Issues Directory** (`docs/development/troubleshooting/resolved-issues/`): Move completed blocker files here with added Resolution section containing final solution, root cause analysis, time to resolution, and prevention measures. Archive within 24 hours of resolution.
- **Methodology Decisions Directory** (`docs/development/troubleshooting/methodology-decisions/`): Document all methodology selection decisions (MVP/Rapid vs Balanced/Standard vs Comprehensive/Enterprise) with rationale, trade-offs considered, success criteria, and rollback conditions. Required for any methodology switches during development.
- **Framework-Specific Directory** (`docs/development/troubleshooting/framework-specific/`): Maintain separate subdirectories for React, Vue, Angular, and vanilla JS with framework-specific troubleshooting patterns, common issues, and resolution strategies. Include CSS Modules integration patterns for each framework.

## Progress Tracking Guidelines
- **Context Preservation** (`docs/progress/context-preservation/`): Create session handoff documents using format `YYYY-MM-DD_session_[feature]_[status].md` containing current task state, completed work, pending decisions, known issues, and next immediate steps. Update before ending each development session.
- **Blocker Impact Documentation** (`docs/progress/blocker-impact/`): Track cumulative impact of blockers on project timeline with weekly impact assessments, methodology adjustment recommendations, and scope modification proposals. Include time-boxed decision points at 15/30/60 minute thresholds.
- **Decision Logging** (`docs/progress/decision-logs/`): Record all architectural, technical, and methodology decisions with timestamp, decision maker, alternatives considered, rationale, success metrics, and review schedule. Required for decisions affecting >4 hours of development time.

## Knowledge Management Protocols
- **Lessons Learned** (`docs/knowledge/lessons-learned/`): Capture insights from completed features, resolved blockers, and methodology implementations. Use format `YYYY-MM-DD_lesson_[category]_[framework].md` with sections: Context, Challenge, Solution, Outcome, Applicability, and Prevention Strategy.
- **Prevention Strategies** (`docs/knowledge/prevention-strategies/`): Document systematic approaches to prevent recurring issues. Include early warning indicators, proactive measures, monitoring strategies, and automated checks. Update after every major blocker resolution.
- **Framework Patterns** (`docs/knowledge/framework-patterns/`): Build reusable patterns for CSS Modules + design system implementations across React, Vue, Angular, and vanilla JS. Include code templates, configuration examples, and integration guides.

## File Naming and Organization Standards
- **Standardized Naming Convention**: All troubleshooting and knowledge management files use format `YYYY-MM-DD_[type]_[component]_[framework].md` where type includes: blocker, resolved, lesson, pattern, decision, session, impact.
- **Categorization System**: Use consistent tags in file headers: [CRITICAL], [HIGH], [MEDIUM], [LOW] for priority; [CSS-MODULES], [DESIGN-SYSTEM], [FRAMEWORK-INTEGRATION] for technical scope; [MVP], [BALANCED], [COMPREHENSIVE] for methodology alignment.
- **Cross-Reference Requirements**: Include related file references in each document using relative paths. Maintain bidirectional links between active-blockers and resolved-issues, lessons-learned and prevention-strategies.

## Methodology Integration Requirements
- **MVP/Rapid Methodology** (2-4 weeks): Focus on critical blockers only, 15-minute decision thresholds, minimal documentation overhead, rapid iteration cycles. Prioritize speed over comprehensive documentation.
- **Balanced/Standard Methodology** (4-8 weeks): Standard blocker tracking, 30-minute decision thresholds, moderate documentation requirements, balanced quality and speed approach.
- **Comprehensive/Enterprise Methodology** (8-12 weeks): Full documentation requirements, 60-minute decision thresholds, extensive knowledge capture, thorough prevention strategy development.
- **Time Threshold Enforcement**: Implement methodology-specific escalation procedures when troubleshooting exceeds time limits. Include automatic methodology reassessment triggers.

## Cross-Directory Integration Rules
- **Knowledge Flow Pipeline**: Active Blockers → Resolved Issues → Lessons Learned → Prevention Strategies → Framework Patterns. Each transition requires specific documentation updates and cross-references.
- **Documentation Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology, formatting, and cross-references across all directories. Use shared glossary and template files.
- **Regular Maintenance**: Weekly review of active blockers for status updates, monthly archival of resolved issues, quarterly review of prevention strategies effectiveness.

## AI Assistant Collaboration Guidelines
- **Session Initialization**: AI assistants must review relevant files from `docs/progress/context-preservation/` and `docs/development/troubleshooting/active-blockers/` before starting work on existing features.
- **Blocker Documentation**: When encountering new issues, AI assistants must create blocker files in active-blockers directory with complete problem description, attempted solutions, and impact assessment.
- **Knowledge Utilization**: Reference existing patterns from `docs/knowledge/framework-patterns/` and prevention strategies before implementing new solutions. Cite specific files and sections in implementation decisions.
- **Progress Updates**: Update context preservation files at natural breakpoints (feature completion, blocker resolution, methodology decisions) with current state and next steps.
- **Cross-Reference Maintenance**: When resolving blockers or implementing solutions, update related files in lessons-learned and prevention-strategies directories with new insights and improved approaches.
- **Methodology Adherence**: Follow time thresholds and documentation requirements specific to current methodology (MVP/Balanced/Comprehensive). Escalate methodology changes through proper decision logging process.
- **Quality Assurance**: Before completing work sessions, verify all documentation is properly cross-referenced, categorized, and follows established naming conventions. Ensure knowledge flow pipeline is maintained.
