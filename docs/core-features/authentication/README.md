# Authentication & Authorization

Comprehensive implementation guidelines for user authentication and authorization systems across different frameworks and methodologies.

## Overview

This directory provides standardized patterns for implementing secure authentication and authorization in web applications, supporting JWT, OAuth, session-based authentication, and role-based access control (RBAC) systems.

## Quick Reference

### Authentication Methods
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Stateless authentication with token-based sessions
- **OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect**: Third-party authentication (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- **Session-based**: Traditional server-side session management
- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enhanced security with 2FA/TOTP

### Authorization Patterns
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: User roles with permissions
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Fine-grained attribute-based permissions
- **Resource-Based Permissions**: Object-level access control

## Methodology Approaches

### MVP/Rapid (2-4 weeks)
- Basic JWT or session authentication
- Simple role-based authorization (admin/user)
- Essential security practices
- Framework authentication libraries

### Balanced/Standard (4-8 weeks)
- Multi-method authentication support
- Comprehensive RBAC implementation
- Security best practices and monitoring
- Refresh token management

### Comprehensive/Enterprise (8-12 weeks)
- Full OAuth 2.0/OIDC implementation
- Advanced RBAC/ABAC systems
- Enterprise security compliance
- Audit logging and monitoring

## Security Considerations

### Essential Security Practices
- Password hashing with bcrypt/Argon2
- HTTPS enforcement
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Secure token storage and transmission

### Common Vulnerabilities
- Weak password policies
- Insecure token storage
- Missing CSRF protection
- Inadequate session management
- Insufficient rate limiting

## Integration Points

### Frontend Integration
- Authentication state management
- Protected route implementation
- Token refresh handling
- User session persistence

### Backend Integration
- Authentication middleware
- Authorization guards
- Token validation
- Session management

## Framework-Specific Considerations

### React
- Context API for auth state
- Protected route components
- Hook-based authentication
- NextAuth.js integration

### Vue.js
- Vuex/Pinia for auth state
- Navigation guards
- Composition API patterns
- Vue Router integration

### Angular
- Authentication services
- Route guards (CanActivate)
- HTTP interceptors
- Angular Universal considerations

### Vanilla JavaScript
- Local storage management
- Fetch API integration
- DOM manipulation for auth UI
- Progressive enhancement

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing
- Authentication service tests
- Token validation tests
- Permission checking tests
- Mock authentication states

### Integration Testing
- Login/logout flows
- Protected route access
- Token refresh scenarios
- Role-based access tests

### End-to-End Testing
- Complete authentication flows
- Multi-device session management
- OAuth provider integration
- Security vulnerability testing

## Troubleshooting Integration

When encountering authentication issues:
1. Check [troubleshooting.md](./troubleshooting.md) for common solutions
2. Create blocker files in `docs/development/troubleshooting/active-blockers/`
3. Use format: `YYYY-MM-DD_blocker_auth_[framework].md`
4. Reference framework-specific guides for detailed implementation help
